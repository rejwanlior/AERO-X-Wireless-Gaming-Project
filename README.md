## 📖 Overview
The **AERO-X Project** is a marketing-focused landing page designed to showcase consumer electronics. The challenge was to create a visual identity that resonates with the gaming community—using dark themes, neon accents, and sharp typography.

This project integrates complex layout techniques like CSS Grid for features and pricing, alongside interactive elements like a "Back to Top" button and smooth anchor navigation.

## 🎓 What I Learned
Through this project, I deepened my understanding of creating cohesive digital products:

* **Visual Hierarchy:** Using light and shadow to direct user attention toward primary Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons.
* **Performance Optimization:** Handling high-quality imagery while maintaining smooth scroll transitions.
* **Interface Consistency:** Ensuring that complex components, like the pricing table, feel integrated into the overall brand language.

## 🚀 Continued Development
Future enhancements planned for this project include:

* **Interactive 3D Model:** Integrating Three.js to allow users to rotate and inspect the headset in 3D.
* **Dynamic Theme Switcher:** Allowing users to change the neon accent color (e.g., from purple to green or red) in real-time.
* **Scroll Animations:** Implementing the GSAP library for more sophisticated "reveal" effects.
